This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started to Dev

1. Install Node.js 18 or higher.
2. Install Yarn package manager.
3. Install Eslint extension on your VS code, then copy and paste this block of code into your VS code settings.
    ```JSON
    
    "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
        "source.fixAll": true,
    },
    "eslint.validate": ["javascript"]

    ```
4. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    
    yarn install

    ```
5. Run the development server:
    ```bash

    yarn dev

    ```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
